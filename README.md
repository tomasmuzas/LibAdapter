# Refresh.NET
A simple CLI tool to easily migrate .NET projects by writing custom migrations.

# Supported migrations:
* Rename class, interface, method, member, namespace
* Add, remove, change, reorder arguments
* Replace class, method
* Change method return type

⚠️Disclaimer! At this point, only references are refactored! Support for end-to-end refactoring (with declarations) is coming soon.
